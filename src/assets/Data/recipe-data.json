        "description": "Eggplant is the best kind of vegetable, which is to say, a multi tasker that can take on many different forms. Itâ€™s as equally at home breaded and fried or, as it is here: roasted until it has a deliciously melted center. Topped with a rich miso dressing, this recipe works equally well as an appetizer course or as a side dish for salmon or chicken. Cooking tip: Watch the sesame seeds while you toast them in the skillet. They can quickly turn from perfectly toasted to burned.",
